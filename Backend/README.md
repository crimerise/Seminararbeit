# Node.js Express Backend

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (already done):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```

The server will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Project Structure
- `server.js`: Main Express server entry point
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies

This is a minimal Express backend. Expand as needed for your project requirements.
